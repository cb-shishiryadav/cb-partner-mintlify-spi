## Developing an App to integration with Chargebee

Chargebee Partners can leverage the Service Provider Interfaces(SPIs)(Attach link) to develop adapters that seamlessly integrate with Chargebee, extending its 
core capabilities to meet diverse business needs.

A partner who wants to integrate their app with Chargebee can follow these steps:

- Understand the openAPI spec and integration details to build a suitable adapter for the integration to work.
- Implement the SPI-defined endpoints.
- Test the integration with the postman collection provider.(Attach link)
- Go through the General(Attach Link) and Technical Requisites(Attach Link) to ensure your app meets the requirements.



## General Requisites:
As a solution provider follow these steps to list your App on Chargebee’s marketplace.

- Chargebee is Personal Identifiable Information (PII) compliant and requires its integrated Apps to be PII compliant as well. Chargebee shares merchant-specific confidential data to the partner app servers to achieve the merchant's usecse. The partner app should provide the SLAs as a part of the agreements with the Merchant and Chargebee specifically for data deletions.
- Chargebee servers are built to serve its requirements; hence the apps/adapters should accept traffic only from allow-listed servers.
- Chargebee and the partner should sign a legal contract dictating terms from both ends.
- As a Capability Solution provider Example: Tax provider, you are expected to 
  - Independently execute an agreement with the merchants before they start using your app. 
  - Elaborately describe the information you will be fetching from Chargebee about your customers or sales transactions. 
  - Share the following with the Chargebee team before going live: (Double check this)
    - Escalation matrix that needs to be followed. 
    - Support email that merchants can reach out to. 
    - Partner support email for technical support. 
    - Links to your merchant user guides. 
    - Specific documents for configurations such as managing API keys and importing plans. 
- Chargebee and the merchants should be informed about the system outages and scheduled maintenance on the external product status page. The integrated app is expected to maintain a status page that includes both actual service provider and adapter's health status. 
- Terms of service, consent and privacy policy pages are to be published on the website.

## Technical Requisites
- **Availability:**- The adapter’s availability must be at the highest level(99.9%). If the solution provider is planning on a scheduled downtime due to maintenance, Chargebee must be provided with advance notification to reduce downtime for its customers.
Note: Uninformed downtimes may result in the app being delisted from the marketplace.

- **Rate limiting:**- Enterprise customers in Chargebee can make up to 500 requests per minute. Tax calculation is a critical part of our operations, and we may need our integrated apps to adhere to at least 300 requests per minute for each customer. These will be tested during integration, and we recommend you ensure the adapters adhere to them.

- **Latency:**- We expect the adapters to serve the requests with a maximum latency of 250ms. Anything greater than this latency is unacceptable.

- **Quality:**- Chargebee believes in delivering top-quality tools to its customers. As a listed app in its marketplace, the tax apps should offer our merchants a consistent and positive experience.

- **Scalability:** Currently, the integrated app should support the scalability as that of Chargebee. Example: Chargebee supports up to 1200 line items in an invoice, and this number will go up in the coming days. Tax providers should support at least these numbers and should be willing to scale this number as per requirement.

- **Security & certifications:** All communication should happen over Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure the channel is secure. As Chargebee is PII compliant and will share customers’ data with you, you need to have PII compliance certification to move forward with the agreement.

- **Concurrency Handling:** the ability to handle concurrency on the adapter service.

## Publishing your app on the marketplace
- Why it is important to publish your app on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.chargebee.com/)?
  - Chargebee’s marketplace is a platform where merchants can discover and install apps that extend Chargebee’s capabilities. By listing your app on the marketplace, you can reach out to a wider audience of Chargebee merchants.
  - Once your app is listed on the marketplace, merchants can install your app with a single click and start using it immediately.
  - You can also leverage Chargebee’s marketing channels to promote your app to a wider audience.
- Initially, your app will be published as a private app on our marketplace. 
- Private apps will be accessible to merchants on Chargebee via a private URL or backend configuration. 
- Once you have five merchants actively engaging with your integration on Chargebee, you can reach out to taxation@chargebee.com to make your app public.
